## 📌 Project Overview

The study aimed to:
- Explore how factors such as **trust**, **satisfaction**, **commitment**, and **social media influence** affect brand loyalty.
- Investigate whether **education** and **occupation** influence brand loyalty using Chi-Square tests.
- Compare generational loyalty patterns through **correlation analysis** and **factor analysis**.

## 🧪 Tools & Techniques

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
- **Statistical Methods**: Descriptive analysis, Chi-Square test, correlation analysis, and factor analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Histograms, scatter plots, and trend lines to support interpretation.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Millennials** showed stronger loyalty tied to trust and commitment.
- **Gen Z** loyalty was more influenced by social media and trends.
- Education and occupation **did not significantly** affect loyalty.
